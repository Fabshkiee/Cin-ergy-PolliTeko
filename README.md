# Poll-It-Tek 

Poll-It-Teko is an interactive web application developed by **Cin>>ergy**, designed to help users find and connect with election candidates whose goals and values align with their own. This platform not only enhances political awareness but also simulates a secure and realistic voting experience.

### 🔐 Login Page
The Login Page features a straightforward user interface that prompts voters to enter their ID number and password. It is connected to a secure database that verifies the entered credentials. If the information matches, the user is granted access to the web application.  
This security measure is essential to help prevent election fraud. Additionally, the login system ensures that each user can only vote once, effectively simulating the integrity of a real-world election.

### 🧩 Pilitugma - "Find Match"
**Pilitugma** (from *Pili*, meaning "Find", and *Tugma*, meaning "Match") is the "Find Match" page and serves as the main feature of the application.  
Users are prompted to answer a series of questions reflecting their political views. After completing the questionnaire, the program identifies and displays the candidate whose platform best aligns with the user's responses.

### 📊 Results Page
The Results Page presents the total number of votes for each candidate and position, ranking candidates from highest to lowest based on vote count.
